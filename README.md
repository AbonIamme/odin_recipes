# Basic Recipe Website

## Introduction

This project involves building a basic recipe website using fundamental HTML skills. The goal is to create a simple webpage structure that links to multiple recipes, laying the groundwork for understanding how websites are organized. 

The project is intentionally minimalistic, focusing solely on HTML to ensure a strong grasp of the basics before adding complexity with CSS or JavaScript in future iterations.

## Project Overview

- **Main Page**: Acts as the index page with links to individual recipe pages.
- **Recipe Pages**: Each recipe page will display the recipe name, a brief description, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Structuring content using semantic HTML elements.
- Linking pages together using relative paths.
- Organizing a project directory for better maintainability.
- Building a clear and navigable web layout.

This project serves as a foundation for more advanced web development practices, providing an opportunity to practice and solidify core HTML skills.
